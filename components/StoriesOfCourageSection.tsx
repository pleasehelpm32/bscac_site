            At BSCAC, we believe in celebrating the extraordinary individuals
            who make up our community. Every building superintendent and cleaner
            has a unique story to tell â€” stories of overcoming challenges,
            showing remarkable courage, and demonstrating incredible resilience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through our "Stories of Courage, Strength, and Resilience" series,
            we aim to highlight these inspiring journeys. By sharing these
            personal accounts, we not only honor the individuals featured but
            also inspire others who may be facing similar challenges.

            We're looking for stories from our community members who have
            demonstrated courage, strength, and resilience in their personal or

            health issues, or personal hardships, your story could inspire and
            encourage others.

          <p>
            With your written permission, we'll create a personal piece about
